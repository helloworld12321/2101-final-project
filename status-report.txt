# CSCI 2101: Data Structures Final Project

Group 5: Luke Burdette, Erik Rauer, and Joe Walbran

## The chosen topic for the project

For this project, we're going to make a text-based version
of the single-player card game Solitaire, also known as
Patience. The user will play by typing out their moves on
the terminal.

## Every student role and tasks in the project

Student | Role
--------|-----------------------
Luke    | Gameplay, `Card` class
Erik    | Gameplay, `Move` class
Joe     | User IO, `Suit` class

## The work done so far

So far, we've done the following:

 - Created and configured a project on GitHub.
 - Written some (but not all) methods to move cards from
   one pile to another.
 - Written some (but not all) methods to print out cards
   on the terminal.
 - Written most of the `Suit` class and some of the
   `Card` class.

## Remaining work to be done

We still need to:

 - Write tests for the methods we've implemented.
 - Settle on a scheme for numbering the piles of cards.
 - Finish writing most classes and methods.

## Any difficulties the group is having

 - Figuring out how to work collaboratively on the
   same code was hard. So far, we've being using GitHub,
   and that's been going okay, but it's been **very**
   complicated.
 - We're still working on a good way to test our code.
