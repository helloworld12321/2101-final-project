# 2101-final-project

Group 5's final project for CSCI 2101: Data Structures, at UMM Morris 2019

## What we know so far

 - We're doing **Solitaire!** Hooray!

## What we still need to figure out

 - Are we doing it graphically or in the terminal?
 - What's the control scheme going to be like? How's the user going to
   interact with the program?
 - What are the rules of Solitaire, exactly?
 - What's our schedule going forward?

------------

Hooray! ♥️♠️♦️♣️
