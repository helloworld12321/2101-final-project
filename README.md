# 2101-final-project

Group 5's final project for CSCI 2101: Data Structures, at UMN Morris 2019

## What we know so far

 - We're doing **Solitaire!** Hooray!
 - We're doing it in the terminal.
 - We know how the user is going to interact with the program (roughly).


## What we still need to figure out

 - What are the rules of Solitaire, exactly?
 - What's our schedule going forward?

(For the record, I vote we don't do it graphically—that would be super hard.

[Here's](https://cardgames.io/solitaire/) a ruleset we might want to use. It
has the benefit that any move can be unambigiously specified using at most
two pieces of information: the initial stack and the destination stack. In
particular, I'd recommend using the variant where you move **3 cards** at a
time from the stock to the waste, rather than just one, and I'd recommend
omitting the undo button. (That's just added complexity, and we already
don't have much time to work.)
