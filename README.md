# 2101-final-project

Group 5's final project for CSCI 2101: Data Structures, at UMM Morris 2019

## What we know so far

 - We're doing **Solitaire!** Hooray!

## What we still need to figure out

 - Are we doing it graphically or in the terminal?
 - What's the control scheme going to be like? How's the user going to
   interact with the program?
 - What are the rules of Solitaire, exactly?
 - What's our schedule going forward?

------------

Yay! ♥️♠️♦️♣️

(For the record, I vote we don't do it graphically—that would be super hard.

[Here's](https://cardgames.io/solitaire/) a ruleset we might want to use. It
has the benefit that any move can be unambigiously specified using at most
two pieces of information: the initial stack and the destination stack. In
particular, I'd recommend using the variant where you move **3 cards** at a
time from the stock to the waste, rather than just one, and I'd recommend
omitting the undo button. (That's just added complexity, and we already
don't have much time to work.)
